      <Text>This is my first app with Aleja and teacher Joan Ayala at CESMAG University.
         We are in the systems room, and Aleja is playing on my phone.
         She has beautiful white hair and is not studying. 
         Meanwhile, my teacher is entertaining my classmates with a soccer game between
